Description: The goal is to print an "aper?u", a short view of a vector, a
    matrix, a data.frame, a list or an array. By default, it prints the first 5
    elements of each dimension. By default, the number of columns is equal to
    the number of lines. If you want to control the selection of the elements,
    you can pass a list, with each element being a vector giving the selection
    for each dimension.
